						<h3>The UKC Magic Society (2012 - 2013)</h3>
						<p>Its been one hell of a year, and we're proud of what we have achieved. Let&rsquo;s take a moment to refelct on the year, and show off some of the highlights from the year... from Steve Price, Chris Wood, and Brendan Rodrigues giving us lectures, to just having fun in the bar and on the street.</p>
						<p>There might be a few snaps from our performance in the Gulbenkian Theatre too :)</p>

				<h2>Who are we?</h2>
				<p>We're a bunch of young magicians based at the University of Kent, Canterbury, and if there's one thing we can't get enough of its magic... We love it so much that we even want to bring our passion for the art to people worldwide. However, we have an odd sense of humor too, you might want to keep an eye out for that.</p>
				<p>Founded in 2011 the UKC Magic Society not only became one of the best societies at the University of Kent for magic (well the only one :P) but it also won the "Best New Society" award. We've raised money for charity, performed at some classy events, and even been to the prestigious Magic Circle! All this in just our first year. Since then we have raised even more money for charity, been to even classier events, back to the magic circle, and put on our very own stage show in the Gulbenkian theatre!</p>

				<h2>We&rsquo;re a social bunch.</h2>
				<p>Despite being a group of slightly quirky student magicians, we&rsquo;re a social bunch. You can find us most Fridays performing around campus. That isn&rsquo;t overly useful for contacting us however, unless it happens to be a Friday. We also have a growing presence online though. Feel free to contact us about anything using any of the following methods.</p>
