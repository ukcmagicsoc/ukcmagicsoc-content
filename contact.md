				<p>The <a href="http://kent.ac.uk/">University of Kent</a>, Canterbury is an easy enough place to find. Well sign posted, and with a large number of transit links, getting to/from our base of operations is a sinch... It only gets confusing once you make it on campus.</p>
				<p>For the past few years we've been situated in Keynes College, however until the start of term this autumn we can't give you an exact location. Be sure to drop us an email if you need to find us sooner.</p>
